# Day-Planner

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
    

For this project, we needed to create a day planner that would allow the user to input tasks & save them to local storage so when the page refreshes, their tasks are still on the page. The timeblocks also needed to reflect whether that hour was in the past, present, or future.
